PenTEsting & Ethical Hacking
============================

Module 1: The Basics
--------------------
Laws:
-HIPAA: Health Insruance Prtability and Accountability Act safeguards private medical info
-PCI-DSS: Protext card holder data, secure network and systems, maintain vuln managemnet program, etc
-SOX: Sarbanes-Oxley Act manage doc controls and assess effectiveness of internal controls, external auditors test
internal controls
-DMCA: Digital Millennium Copyright Act
-FISMA: Federal Info Security Management Act has annual reviews of info sec 
-ISO/IEC 27001:2013: Management examins info sec risks, design and implement sec controls and monirtor controls

Module 2: Footprinting
----------------------
Footprinting Types:
-Active: Interacting with person of interest, performing port scan
-Passive: Publicly available info, google search

Benefits:
-Knowledge of security posture
-Reduce focus area
-Identify vulnerabilites
-Networking mapping

How to footprint?
-Search engines / google hacking
-Shodan (hackers search engine that allows you to see vulnerable devices)
-Whois
-Social media
-Maltego
-Recon-ng
-OSRFramework

Google Hacking:
-filetype: type , searched for only files of specific type
-intitle: string, searched for pages that contain the string in the title
-inurl: string, displays pages with the string in the URL 
-site: domain, displayes pages for specific website/domain

Nikto:
-To find potentials vulnerabilities on a website
nikto -e 1 -h google.ca

Theharvester:
-Good info gathering
-Used an example command displayed from theharvester -h 

Google Hacking:
-Use the google hacking database on exploit-db


Module 3: Scanning & Enumeration
--------------------------------

Scanning Methodology:
1. Check for live systems
2. Check for open ports
3. Scan beyond the IDS 
4. Banner grabbing
5. Scan for vulnerabilities
6. Draw network diagrams
7. Prepare proxies

Three-way Handshake:
-SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK

TCP Header Flags
-Synchronize(SYN): set during intial communication establishment, indicates negotiation of parameters and sequence numbers
-Acknowledgments(ACK): set as an acknowledgment of a SYN flag
-Reset(RST): Forces termination of communication in both directions
-Finish(FIN): Flag signifying an ordered close to communications
-Push(PSH): Forces delivery of data, without concern for buffering
-Urgent(URG): indicates the data is being sent out of band

TCP Handshake:
 
Host A -> (SYN 100) -> Host B : Request to communicate
Host A <- (SYN 300 / ACK 101) <- Host B : Acknowledge communication and request communication
Host A -> (ACK 301) -> Host B : Acknowledge communication established

Fragmentation:
-Breaking packets into smaller chunks to get them past intrusion detection systems
-Can use colasoft packet builder for this

ICMP:
-Internet Control Message Protocol

ICMP Message Type           Description
0:Echo Reply                Answer to the Type 8 Echo Request
3:Destination Unreachable   0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13
4:Source Quench             A congestion control message
5:Redirect                  0(Redirect network), 1(Redirect host)
8:Echo Request              Ping message that requests the Echo reply
11:Time exceeded

Types of port scans
-Full-open: Runs three-way handshake on all ports, easy to detect 
-Half-open: Stealthy, no 3 way handshake
-Inverse TCP: uses FIN,URG,PSH flags, no response means port is open
-XMAS: Does not work on Windows
-ACK: ACK packet sent and header reviewed for RST packet TTL 64<
-IDLE: Spoofed IP address

Banner Grabbing
-Mainly trying to check waht operating system is in use
-Telnet 10.10.10.152 80

Enumeration:
-Discovery of hosts or devices
-LDAP / SNMP

Vulnerability Tools:
-OpenVAS 
-Nessus 

Vulnerability Scoring System
-Scores range from o to 10

Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
Discover Vuln -> Prioritize Assets -> Assess -> Report -> Remediate -> Verify -> Repeat

Port Scanning Lab
-----------------
nmap {target ip}  -syn scans 1000 of the most common ports
hping3 -8 0-5000 -S {target ip}  -syn scans ports 0-5000
