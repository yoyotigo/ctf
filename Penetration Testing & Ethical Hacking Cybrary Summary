PenTEsting & Ethical Hacking
============================

Module 1: The Basics
--------------------
Laws:
-HIPAA: Health Insruance Prtability and Accountability Act safeguards private medical info
-PCI-DSS: Protext card holder data, secure network and systems, maintain vuln managemnet program, etc
-SOX: Sarbanes-Oxley Act manage doc controls and assess effectiveness of internal controls, external auditors test
internal controls
-DMCA: Digital Millennium Copyright Act
-FISMA: Federal Info Security Management Act has annual reviews of info sec 
-ISO/IEC 27001:2013: Management examins info sec risks, design and implement sec controls and monirtor controls

Module 2: Footprinting
----------------------
Footprinting Types:
-Active: Interacting with person of interest, performing port scan
-Passive: Publicly available info, google search

Benefits:
-Knowledge of security posture
-Reduce focus area
-Identify vulnerabilites
-Networking mapping

How to footprint?
-Search engines / google hacking
-Shodan (hackers search engine that allows you to see vulnerable devices)
-Whois
-Social media
-Maltego
-Recon-ng
-OSRFramework

Google Hacking:
-filetype: type , searched for only files of specific type
-intitle: string, searched for pages that contain the string in the title
-inurl: string, displays pages with the string in the URL 
-site: domain, displayes pages for specific website/domain

Nikto:
-To find potentials vulnerabilities on a website
nikto -e 1 -h google.ca

Theharvester:
-Good info gathering
-Used an example command displayed from theharvester -h 

Google Hacking:
-Use the google hacking database on exploit-db


Module 3: Scanning & Enumeration
--------------------------------

Scanning Methodology:
1. Check for live systems
2. Check for open ports
3. Scan beyond the IDS 
4. Banner grabbing
5. Scan for vulnerabilities
6. Draw network diagrams
7. Prepare proxies

Three-way Handshake:
-SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK

TCP Header Flags
-Synchronize(SYN): set during intial communication establishment, indicates negotiation of parameters and sequence numbers
-Acknowledgments(ACK): set as an acknowledgment of a SYN flag
-Reset(RST): Forces termination of communication in both directions
-Finish(FIN): Flag signifying an ordered close to communications
-Push(PSH): Forces delivery of data, without concern for buffering
-Urgent(URG): indicates the data is being sent out of band

TCP Handshake:
 
Host A -> (SYN 100) -> Host B : Request to communicate
Host A <- (SYN 300 / ACK 101) <- Host B : Acknowledge communication and request communication
Host A -> (ACK 301) -> Host B : Acknowledge communication established

Fragmentation:
-Breaking packets into smaller chunks to get them past intrusion detection systems
-Can use colasoft packet builder for this

ICMP:
-Internet Control Message Protocol

ICMP Message Type           Description
0:Echo Reply                Answer to the Type 8 Echo Request
3:Destination Unreachable   0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13
4:Source Quench             A congestion control message
5:Redirect                  0(Redirect network), 1(Redirect host)
8:Echo Request              Ping message that requests the Echo reply
11:Time exceeded

Types of port scans
-Full-open: Runs three-way handshake on all ports, easy to detect 
-Half-open: Stealthy, no 3 way handshake
-Inverse TCP: uses FIN,URG,PSH flags, no response means port is open
-XMAS: Does not work on Windows
-ACK: ACK packet sent and header reviewed for RST packet TTL 64<
-IDLE: Spoofed IP address

Banner Grabbing
-Mainly trying to check waht operating system is in use
-Telnet 10.10.10.152 80

Enumeration:
-Discovery of hosts or devices
-LDAP / SNMP

Vulnerability Tools:
-OpenVAS 
-Nessus 

Vulnerability Scoring System
-Scores range from o to 10

Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
Discover Vuln -> Prioritize Assets -> Assess -> Report -> Remediate -> Verify -> Repeat

Port Scanning Lab
-----------------
nmap {target ip}  -syn scans 1000 of the most common ports
hping3 -8 0-5000 -S {target ip}  -syn scans ports 0-5000

Fingerprinting
--------------
nmap -o allows for operating system detection

Mapping Networks
----------------
Zenmap, GUI of nmap
Once scan is complete (use -sn to skip ports) go to topology tab and take a look at subtabs

Banner Grabbing
---------------
telnet {target ip+port}
once connected type GET /dvwa/HTTP/1.1 press enter a few times
then type Host: {target.ip} and press enter a couple of times and 
telnet returns server, cookies, etc
netcat:
nc {target.ip+port}
GET /dwva/ HTTP/1.1
HOST: {target.ip}

Enumeration
-----------
Can use nslookup / dig / finger



System Hacking
==============

Sam File:
-Security Accounts Manager
-Stores password hashes
-SYSKEY

Password Attacks:
-Dictionary, brute-force, rule-based, rainbow tables
-Rainbow tables are precomputed tables

Password Salting:
-Random data input in the hash
-Randomly generated for each password

Tools:
-Aircrack ng
-Cain and Abel
-John the Ripper
-Hydra
-Hashcat

Spectre and Meltdown:
-Computer chips contain security flaws
-Protected memory being stored in CPU cache
-Most major flaws are patched as of now

Rootkits:
-Provide continued access to a computer
-Run stealthily
-Horse Pill: Infects initial ramdisk in linux so it controls early in boot process
-Gray fish: attributed to the Equation Group (NSA), listen as Trojan.Wind32.GrayFish.b

Steganography Tools
-QuickStego: BMP, JPEG, GIF
-OpenStego: BMP, PNG
-MP3Stego: MP3

What does TFTP stand for?
Trivial File Transfer Protocol

TFTP can be used to?
Allow client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host

What RFC helps define how TFTP protocol works?
RFC 1350

What allows a attacker to open command-line shells on your pc and collect your info?
Backdoor Trojans

TFTP: Trivial File Transfer Protocol, which is a simple protocol for transferring files to or from a remote host. 
Transfer requests are intiaited on port 69, TFTP cannot do user auth or list directories

Examples of RAT Backdoors:
-Gh0st
-Mirai botnet: IoT


Module 5: Malware
=================

-Computer slows down, ad pop-ups, system resources use is high, new toolbars/extensions, antivirus disabled

Viruses:
-Malicious computer programs that can self-replicate. They attach to another ifle
and move host to host. 
-The virus needs to have some kind of host program to propagate
-Design->Replication->Launch->Detection->Incorporation->Elimination
-Boot sector virus: moves voot sector to another location on hdd 
-Randomware: Locks you out of system
-Shell virus: Wraps itself around code of an application
-Cluster virus: modfies discovery table entries, so system and user processes are pointed to virus code
-Multipartite virus: Attempts to infect boot sector and files at the same time
-Macro virus: Infects template files created by microsoft office
-Polymorphic code virus: mutates its code, so signature constantly changes
-Encryption virus: uses encryption to evade antivirus detection
-Metamorphic virus: Reqrites itself every time it infects a new file
-Stealth virus: attempts to evade AV by intercepting antivirus request to the OS
-Cavity virus: overwites portions of host files, so it doesn't increase size of files
-Sparse infector virus: Infect occasionally (once a month)
-File extension virus: Changes file extensions and people who have file extension view turned off

Worms:
-A self-replicating and self-propagating program that uses networking mechanisms to spread itself. 
Worms eat up resources
-Code red: exploited IIS servers in 2001 using buffer overflow
-SQL Slammer: DoS worm that attacked buffer overflow weaknesses in Microsft SQL
-Nimda: Spread through open network shares,websites & emails

Trojans: 
-Appear to perform a desired function, but actually performs actions without the users knowledge,
intended to steal info or harm users system/data
-Covert channel: used to transmit info in a way that is illegitimate or impossible
-Over channel: Used to send info or perform other actions in legitimate way
-Indications of Trojan infection: CD drawer open/close, Computer screen issues,
browser redirection, mouse disappear, documents randomly print, etc

Trojan common ports:
-Back orifice: UDP 31337/31338
-Beast: TCP 6666
-Whack-a-mole: TCP 12361/12362

Knowledge Check:
Q1. Port 23 is what?

Q2. Port 389 is what?
-LDAP Lightweight directory access protocol, Port 110 is POP3, Port 88 is KErberos
Q3. Hash caulclation tools can be used to check?
